# Visual-Jarvis

Visual Jarvis is an innovative AI project that allows users to draw in the air using fixed hand gestures, with the drawings then processed by Google's Gemini-1.5-flash LLM to produce various results. The project includes a Streamlit web application for ease of use.

## Features:
* **Air Drawing**: Use hand gestures to draw in the air using your video feed.
* **AI Integration**: Drawings are processed by Google's Gemini-1.5-flash LLM to generate various outputs.
    * If the drawings are math problems, the AI will be prompted to provide the solution for them.
    * If the drawings are not math problems, the AI will try to identify the object in the drawing and provide a fun fact about it.
* **Streamlit Webapp**: Simple and intuitive web application interface for user interaction.

## Requirements:
To run this project, you'll need:
* Python
* OpenCV
* MediaPipe
* Pillow
* Streamlit
* Google Generative AI Library
